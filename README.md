## Author and Acknowledgements
 - This application was developed by [Bianca Aspin](https://github.com/baspin94) as my capstone project for [Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/), which I graduated from in April 2023.
 - The national parks data was furnished by the National Parks Service via the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm).
 - The user interface utilizes [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a UI library which emphasizes web accessibility â€“ each of their components comes with WAI-ARIA roles and attributes already baked in.
